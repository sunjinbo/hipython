Jerry: Hi Fei, how's the new job going?
Fei: It's very exciting and I'm really learning a lot. At the same time, it's also quite tiring. I need a break today.
Jerry: How about if we go to lunch together?
Fei: No, I want to do something more active. I have an idea. Why don't we go to the park and fly a kite!
